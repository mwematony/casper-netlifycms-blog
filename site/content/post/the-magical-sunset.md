For long,I've always had a negative altitude on sunset. Few years later I realized that sunset is the sweetest time to let go all the day's feeling.
By viewing the sunset, one has a feeling of satisfaction and this gives one hope of seeing sunrise.
Why face another day with stress from the day before?
Mother nature gives us perfect time to end all the days feelings and get ready to face a new day. By that, seeing the yellow fading rays, nature gives us perfect time to reprogram our minds.
     By doing this, we set our minds in the positive way that helps us have a reason to enjoy everyday given to us by God.
